AsciidocToGo is still under development and not anchor:todo[all functions are implemented yet].


== Installation

AsciidocToGo is delivered as a ZIP file at the moment.
Due to the "install by use" feature of miktex it is suggested to
install AsciidocToGo NOT in the default programm folder (e. g. C:\Program Files").
